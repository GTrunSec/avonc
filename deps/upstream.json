Each member has a balance computed from the project bills.\nThis way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan\ntelling you which payments to make to reset the projet balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users.\nOnce you've got access to a project (as a guest or as a Nextcloud user), there is no restriction on what you can add/edit/delete.\nProjects can be accessed and modified by\npeople without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.\n\n[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is available (soon on F-Droid).\n\n## Features\n\n* create/edit/delete project, member, bill\n* check member balances\n* display project's statistics\n* display settlement plan\n* guest access for people outside Nextcloud\n* share a project with Nextcloud users\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 15 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n Help us to translate this app on [Nextcloud-Cospend/MoneyBuster Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/moneybuster).\n\n Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nLink to Nextcloud application website : https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/cospend\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* ...\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the URL (rather than in the logging app settings. Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name.\nSetting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n*  Display location history\n*   Filter points\n*   Manually edit/add/delete points\n*   Edit devices (rename, change color/shape, move to another session)\n*   Define geofencing zones for devices\n*   Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n*   Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n*  Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n*   Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device).\n*   Display sessions statistics\n*  [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorized user can log with this name\n*  Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n*   Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 15 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colors and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.",
