It was inspired by the great [IHateMoney](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/).\n\nYou can use it when you share a house, when you go on vacation with friends, whenever you share money with others.\n\nIt lets you create projects with members and bills. Each member has a balance computed from the project bills. This way you can see who owes the group and who the group owes. Ultimately you can ask for a settlement plan telling you which payments to make to reset members balances.\n\nProject members are independent from Nextcloud users. Once you've got access to a project (as a guest or as a Nextcloud user), there is no restriction on what you can add/edit/delete. Projects can be accessed and modified by people without a Nextcloud account. Each project has an ID and a password for guest access.\n\n[MoneyBuster](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/moneybuster) Android client is [available in F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.eneiluj.moneybuster/).\n\n## Features\n\n*  create/edit/delete projects, members, bills\n*  check member balances\n*  display project statistics\n*  display settlement plan\n*  automatically create reimbursement bills from settlement plan\n*  create recurring bills (day/week/month/year)\n*  optionally provide custom amount for each member in new bills\n*  insert public link to a personal file in bill description (picture of physical bill for example)\n*  guest access for people outside Nextcloud\n*  share a project with Nextcloud users\n*  import/export projects as csv (compatible with csv files from IHateMoney)\n*  add external projects (hosted by another Nextcloud instance)\n*  generate link/QRCode to easily import projects in MoneyBuster\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 15 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n Help us to translate this app on [Nextcloud-Cospend/MoneyBuster Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/moneybuster).\n\n Check out other ways to help in the [contribution guidelines](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/cospend-nc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* it does not make you rich\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

All browsers should be able to play at least mp3.\n\nIn the library view, you can play tracks by album or artist, create custom playlists, or shuffle play over your whole library. In the Files view, an audio file can be played with one click and the playback continues to next files of the folder until stopped. The app includes also an Ampache-compatible server.\n\nLimitations: The library view does not scale well to huge music collections. The practical maximum number of tracks the app can handle is ~50 000 on Firefox and lower on other browsers. The playback from Files works regardless of the collection size.",

Choose the [logging method](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#logging-methods) you prefer.\n* Watch the session's devices location in real time (or not) in PhoneTrack or share it with public pages.\n\n(\\*) Don't forget to set the device name in the link (rather than in the logging app settings). Replace \"yourname\" with the desired device name. Setting the device name in logging app settings only works with Owntracks, Traccar and OpenGTS.\n\nOn PhoneTrack main page, while watching a session, you can :\n\n*  Display location history\n*  Filter points\n*  Manually edit/add/delete points\n*  Edit devices (rename, change color/shape, move to another session)\n*  Define geofencing zones for devices\n*  Define proximity alerts for device pairs\n*  Share a session to other Nextcloud users or with a public link (read-only)\n*  Generate public share links with optional restrictions (filters, device name, last positions only, geofencing simplification)\n*  Import/export a session in GPX format (one file with one track per device or one file per device)\n*  Display sessions statistics\n*  [Reserve a device name](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/userdoc#device-name-reservation) to make sure only authorized user can log with this name\n*  Toggle session auto export and auto purge (daily/weekly/monthly)\n*  Choose what to do when point number quota is reached (block logging or delete oldest point)\n\nPublic page and public filtered page work like main page except there is only one session displayed, everything is read-only and there is no need to be logged in.\n\nThis app is tested on Nextcloud 15 with Firefox 57+ and Chromium.\n\nThis app is compatible with theming colors and accessibility themes !\n\nThis app is under development.\n\n## Install\n\nSee the [AdminDoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc) for installation details.\n\nCheck [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#change-log) file to see what's new and what's coming in next release.\n\nCheck [AUTHORS](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/blob/master/AUTHORS.md#authors) file to see complete list of authors.\n\n## Known issues\n\n* PhoneTrack **now works** with Nextcloud group restriction activated. See [admindoc](https://gitlab.com/eneiluj/phonetrack-oc/wikis/admindoc#issue-with-phonetrack-restricted-to-some-groups-in-nextcloud).\n\nAny feedback will be appreciated.\n\n## Donation\n\nI develop this app during my free time.\n\n* [Donate with Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=66PALMY8SF5JE) (you don't need a paypal account)\n* [Donate with Liberapay : ![Donate using Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/assets/widgets/donate.svg)](https://liberapay.com/eneiluj/donate)",

Login button appear at login page if app id specified. Settings are in \"Social login\" section of settings page.\n\n## Telegram\n\nFor using telegram login you need create bot and connect it to domain as described here https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login\n\nThen specify bot login and token in \"Social login\" section of admin settings page\n\n**Telegram auth will not work everywhere another than browser.***\n\n## Built-in OAuth providers\n\nYou can create app by followed urls. You can copy link of certain login button to get proper \"redirect url\" for OAuth app setting.\n\n* [Google](https://console.developers.google.com)\n* [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/loginwithamazon/console/site/lwa/overview.html)\n* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)\n* [Twitter](https://apps.twitter.com/)\n* [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/developers)\n* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me#top)\n\nDetails about \"Allow login only from specified domain\" google setting you can find here [#44](https://github.com/zorn-v/nextcloud-social-login/issues/44)\n\nCustom providers is on your own. Officially not supported\n\n## Config\n\nYou can use `'social_login_auto_redirect' =&gt; true` setting in `config.php` for auto redirect unauthorized users to social login if only one provider is configured.\n\n## Hint\n\n### About Callback(Reply) Url\nYou can copy link from specific login button on login page and paste it on provider's website as callback url!\nSome users may get strange reply(Callback) url error from provider even if you pasted the right url, that's because your nextcloud server may generate http urls when you are actually using https.\nPlease set 'overwriteprotocol' =&gt; 'https', in your config.php file.",
